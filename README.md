Overview
In this project, Ihave recreated a simplified version of a footer using tailwind. I have created a beautiful  footer that is viewed the same way in different screen sizes and devices.
Reflections
Styling Elements: I was able to style the profile image, user information, and gallery section effectively, closely resembling an Instagram profile.
Mastery Areas: 
None, I really struggled with tailwind

Challenges Faced:
I think I was okay with the css, but using the tailwind css sort of made me confused, the keywords and everything. But eventually I will get the hang of it.

Areas for Improvement:
Getting comfortable with tailwind, probably getting more practise exercises.

Code Optimization:
While I think I have achieved my code, I think I can try to get comfortable with the tailwind sytax, improve my codes readability as well as its readability.

Creative Design Choices: 
I think I have adhered to the reference images, I would like to explore more with tailwind and make other projects.

Overall Learning Experience
I have honestly struggled with this project, the tailwind and my overall experience was rather draining. But would like to know it more for future purposes.
