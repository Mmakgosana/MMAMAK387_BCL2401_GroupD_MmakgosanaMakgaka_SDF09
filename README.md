Overview
In this project, Ihave recreated a simplified version of a footer using tailwind. I have created a beautiful  footer that is viewed the same way in different screen sizes and devices.
Reflections
Styling Elements: I was able to style the profile image, user information, and gallery section effectively, closely resembling an Instagram profile.
Mastery Areas: None, I really struggled with tailwind

Challenges Faced
I think I was okay with the css, but using the tailwind css sort of made me confused, the keywords and everything. But eventually I will get the hang of it.

Areas for Improvement
Getting co
Code Optimization: While my code achieved the desired outcome, I believe I can improve its efficiency and readability.
Creative Design Choices: I adhered closely to the Instagram layout for practice but would like to experiment with more creative design choices in future projects.
Overall Learning Experience
This project was an invaluable hands-on experience in applying CSS layout techniques. It helped solidify my understanding of CSS and its practical applications in web development. I look forward to building on these skills in future projects.
